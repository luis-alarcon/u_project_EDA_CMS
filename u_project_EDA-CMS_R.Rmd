This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)

```

```{r}
df_cms <- read.csv("./datasets/df_cms.csv")
head(df_cms)
```

```{r}
df_null <- df_cms[is.na(df_cms$Census.Region),]

head(df_null)
```


```{r}
cr_ncr_p1 <- ggplot(data=df_cms,aes(x=df_cms$Census.Region)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")

cr_ncrd_p1 <- ggplot(data=df_cms,aes(x=df_cms$Census.Region.Division)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")

cr_nfr_p1 <- ggplot(data=df_cms,aes(x=df_cms$Federal.Region)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")

cr_near_p1 <- ggplot(data=df_cms,aes(x=df_cms$Economic.Analysis.Region)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")

grid.arrange(cr_ncr_p1,cr_ncrd_p1,cr_nfr_p1,cr_near_p1, cols=2)

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
